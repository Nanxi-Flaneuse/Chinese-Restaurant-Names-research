You will decide whether the name of the restaurant '''{EN_NAME}''' belongs to the Romanized category. As long as a name contains one word that classifies as Romanized, the entire name classifies as 
Romanized. 

Here is the criteria for classifying Romanized:

Romanized names contain Romanized Chinese characters that are NOT names of a person or names that indicate relationships. 
Romanized Chinese characters means that we are spelling the pronunciation of Chinese characters using English letters. Here are some common examples:
- "Lu Fu Zi"
- "Wei Shi Jia"
- "Shu Da Xia"
- "Hai Di Lao" 
- "Din Tai Fung " 
- "Yi Mei"
