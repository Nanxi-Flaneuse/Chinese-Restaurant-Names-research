You will decide whether the name of the restaurant '''{EN_NAME}''' belongs to the Creative category. As long as a name contains one word that classifies as Creative, the entire name classifies as 
Creative. 

Here is the criteria for classifying Creative:

Creative refers to names that contain puns or words used creatively. Here are some examples:
    - "wok with me" (sounds like “walk with me” and "wok" is a pun for "walk") 
    - "pho king good" (sounds like “fucking good” and "pho king" is a pun for "fucking")
    - "rice to meet you" (sounds like “nice to meet you” and "rice" is a pun for "nice")
    - "Wok N Talk" ('wok' ryhmes with 'talk' and "wok" is a pun for "walk")

* note that Chinese restaurant owners often like to use stereotypical Chinese ingredients, cooking utensils, or specialties to give their restaurants creative name.
