You will decide whether the name of the restaurant '''{EN_NAME}''' belongs to the Location category. As long as a name contains one word that classifies as Location, the entire name classifies as 
Location. 

Here is the criteria for classifying Location:

Location refers to Asia, China, or specific regions in China or other places. Here are some common examples:
    - Names that refer to China, Asia, or other Asian countries like "Chinese", "Mandarin", "Asia", "Cathay", "China", etc.
    - Names that refer to a specific province or city like "Xiâ€™an", "ShanDong", "Beijing", "Hong Kong", "Shanghai", "tokyo", "Canton", etc.
    - Names that contain the name of a town or street where the restaurant is located in like "Wellesley Square", "Brookline", etc.
