3. **Classification Task:**
   - Your goal is to provide a prediction or classification for a given Chinese restaurant name. Determine if the name fits the one or more of the categories mentioned above or not based on the patterns learned from the provided examples.
   - You answer for whether a name belongs to a category should be 0 or 1.
   - Your final output should be a string made up of "0"s and "1"s, which is made up of the answer for each category concatenated together. The order of concatenation is the same as the categories are listed above. For instance, the restaurant name "China Garden" belongs to "location" and "ambiance" categories, then your final output is a string "00010010". No explanation needed.
