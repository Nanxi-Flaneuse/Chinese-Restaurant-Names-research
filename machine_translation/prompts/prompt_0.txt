Here is a list of rules to translate Chinese restaurant names to English:
    1. Translate each name character by character. No need to care about English grammar. Some examples:
        '西海楼' 'West Sea House'
        '福满楼' 'Luck Full House'
        '锦灿' 'Golden Splendor'
        '二舅烤肉' 'Second Uncle Barbecue'
    2. If a character or a phrase has a Chinese meaning and doesn’t look like a person’s name, return the literal translation of this character or phrase instead of the Romanized version and please pay special attention to this.
    3. Make sure there’s as little Romanization in the translations as possible. Here are some examples for your reference. For instance,
        '明苑阁' 'Bright Garden Pavillion'
        '川香园' 'Sichuan Fragrant Garden'
        '那家老院子' 'Na's Old Yard'
        '芳芳小食' 'Fang Fang Snacks'
Make sure to refer to these examples when you do the translation.
Give me the literal english translation of the Chinese restaurant name """{CN_NAME}""". Only return the english translations and don't return the Chinese names. No explanation needed. No double or single quotes needed.
