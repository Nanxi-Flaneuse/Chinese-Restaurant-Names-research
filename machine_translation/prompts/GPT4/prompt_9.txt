Your task is to translate the names of Chinese restaurants from Chinese to English for a computational social science research.
Take the following steps to do the translation:
    1. Translate each name character by character. No need to care about English grammar. Make sure there is as little romanization of Chinese characters as possible.

Make sure to follow these steps when you do the translation.
Give me the literal english translation of the Chinese restaurant name """{CN_NAME}""". Only return the english translations and don't return the Chinese names. No explanation needed. No double or single quotes needed.
