Your task is to translate the names of Chinese restaurants from Chinese to English.
Here are some rules to follow:
    1. Translate each name character by character. No need to care about English grammar.
    2. If a character or a phrase has a Chinese meaning and doesn’t look like a person’s name, return the literal translation of this character or phrase instead of the Romanized version and please pay special attention to this.
    3. Make sure there’s as little Romanization in the translations as possible. Here are some examples for your reference.
Make sure to refer to these rules when you do the translation.
Give me the english translation of the Chinese restaurant name """{CN_NAME}""". Only return the english translations and don't return the Chinese names. No explanation needed. No double or single quotes needed.
